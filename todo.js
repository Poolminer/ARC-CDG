Subject: Grouping & Compositionality
    • Object Assembly – Combine parts to form complex shapes.
    • Tiling & Repetition – Pattern replication across the grid.
    • Group Consistency – Apply rules to entire categories of items.
    • Substructure Matching – Find or replicate internal structure.
Subject: Symmetry & Regularity
    • Symmetry Classification – Assign colors to objects based on their symmetry type (vertical, horizontal, diagonal).
    • Symmetry Breaking – Detect the anomaly in a symmetric pattern.
    • Symmetry Repairing – Restore a complete symmetric structure from an incomplete one.
Subject: Counting & Arithmetic Reasoning
    • Object Counting
    • Add/Subtract Objects – Observe changes in quantity.
    • Proportional Reasoning – Double, half, or equal group sizes.
    • Multiplicative Grouping – Replicate or generate by rule.
Subject: Gestalt Principles of Perception
    • Proximity – Objects near each other are perceived as grouped.
    • Similarity – Objects that share color or shape are grouped.
    • Continuity – Aligned elements are perceived as flowing lines or patterns.
    • Closure – Incomplete shapes are perceived as wholes.
    • Connectedness – Visually linked objects form a single group.
    • Common Fate – Objects that move together are seen as part of the same group.
Subject: Topology & Connectivity
    • Path Finding – Solve structured mazes or spaces by tracing a unique valid path between points.
    • Networks & Loops – Detect complete and incomplete circuits.
    • Isolation vs Connectedness – Separate components vs single masses.
    • Enclosure Detection – Identify fully enclosed areas after learning grouping and connectivity.
Subject: Pattern Recognition & Extrapolation
    • Repeating Patterns – Across rows, columns, and diagonals.
    • Local Pattern Matching – Subgrids repeated across space.
    • Anomaly Detection – Find the item that breaks a rule.
    • Alternation & Sequences – ABC, ABAB, etc.
Subject: Analogical & Relational Reasoning
    • Visual Analogies – A:B :: C:?
    • Transformation Transfer – Apply rule from one case to another.
    • Inter-Example Rule Inference – Learn from multiple demos.
    • Combined Rule Application – Multi-step or compound reasoning.
Subject: Conditional & Logical Rules
    • If-Then Behavior – Conditional transformations.
    • Multi-Condition Rules – Nested logical reasoning.
    • Rule Switching – Detect shifts in transformation logic.
    • Rule Composition – Apply a sequence of logical steps.
Subject: Attention, Focus & Salience
    • Salience Detection – Largest, centered, most active object.
    • Structural Hierarchy – Pattern inside pattern.
    • Occlusion Handling – Reason under partial visibility.
    • Noise Filtering – Focus on relevant parts amidst distractors.
